# chat-application
This project is to create a multiple server-client chat application in java
There are two java files which are called server-frame.java and client_frame.java. 
The server_frame.java file is to create a chat server which supports text transfer. The server receives connection from clients. It supports forwarding of message from client to client.
The client_frame.java file is to create a chat client which transfers text and files. This chat client connects to other clients as well as connecting to the server.
These is also one file which is called images.jpeg. This file is used for client_frame.
I used NetBeans IDE 8.2 to test these three files and run the program.
